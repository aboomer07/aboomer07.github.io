    <p style="font-size:12pt">
      I am currently working as a Senior Data Scientist for Kevala, where I work on grid modeling, load forecasting, and optimization. I received my Masters in Econometrics and Empirical Economics from the Toulouse School of Economics. My main areas of interest are the intersections of energy, climate, housing, transportation, and city design. You can explore my projects page to see examples of my work and learn more about my skills and experience.

      My primary analytical tools are Python and SQL, and I have extensive experience in applying machine learning techniques to solve complex problems and deploy models into production. I am proficient with the GCP ecosystem and have working knowledge of AWS and Databricks. I also have experience with R, STATA and Matlab.

      I am an avid podcast listener, and stay up to date with 99% invisible, Throughline, Planet Money, and The War on Cars. I am also a regular reader of Bloomberg City Lab, Streetsblog, Strong Towns, and BikePortland (a local biking blog). In my free time, I enjoy hiking, biking, ping pong, mushroom hunting, and cooking.
